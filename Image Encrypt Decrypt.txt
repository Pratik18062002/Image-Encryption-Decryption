A] Image Encryption

1) Browse Image from Computer
2) Convert image into base64 String
3) send that base64 String to encrypt using AES algorithm and to encrypt image it is required to use some encryption key (AES algorithm supports 128-bit encryption key)
4) you will get Encrypted String

B] Image Decryption

1) Decrypt the encoded String using same encryption key you will get base64 string
2) convert base64 string into image
